        Atelier was founded with a vision for slow, meaningful fashion. Our journey began in 2015, inspired by a desire to honor traditional craftsmanship while embracing modern design. Each collection is a testament to our commitment to sustainability, artistry, and timeless style.

      <p className="animate-fade-in-up delay-200">
        From our first handwoven knitwear pieces to our latest eco-friendly collections, we have always believed that true luxury lies in the detailsâ€”the careful selection of materials, the skill of our artisans, and the stories woven into every garment.
      </p>
      <p className="animate-fade-in-up delay-300">
        Today, Atelier continues to grow, partnering with skilled makers and supporting ethical practices. We invite you to be part of our story and celebrate the beauty of mindful creation.
